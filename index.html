		  HOWZATT is a Test against time of your knowledge on the 50 over Format of the Cricket World Cup. The objective is to identify the mystery player, before the clock runs out.
		  <br><br>
		  You need to identify a player who has either been a Winning Captain, has scored the Most Runs, taken the Most Wickets, been the Man of the Match in the Finals or been the Player of the Series in a particular edition. 
		  <br><br>
		  You get a total of 60 seconds to identify the player. At set intervals, you get a clue about the mystery player. You lose if the clock winds down!
		  <br><br>
		  Use the on-screen keyboard to key in your answer. You can have multiple goes and Hit Enter to submit. The clock is stopped when you identify the player successfully.  	
		  <br><br>
		  Pay attention to the number of characters in the players first and last names. This is another clue, that could be of help. 
		  <br><br>		  
		  The hints are revealed in the following sequence :-
		  <br><br>
			<ol>
			  <li>After 5 seconds, the edition of the World Cup in which the player won the accolade is revealed.</li>
			  <li>At the end of 15 seconds, the nationality of the player is revealed.</li>
			  <li>At the end of 25 seconds, the actual accolade that the player achieved in that particular edition is revealed.</li>
			  <li>At the end of 35 seconds, the first letter of the players first name is revealed.</li>
			  <li>At the end of 45 seconds, the first letter of the players last name (middle name if applicable) is revealed.</li>
			</ol>
